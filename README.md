# time-series

This project contains some ways in which long-term data of two market indices, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The purpose of this analysis is not so much to glean economic implications or to devise strategies, but of exploring some ways of looking at highly nonlinear, long-term data. 

We will keep updating this project with time by adding more statistical analysis.
